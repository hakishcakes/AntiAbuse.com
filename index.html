    <center> <h1>What is Abuse</h1></center>
    <p>Abuse is a situation in which a person is treated in a way that is harmful to them. Abuse can occur to anyone of any age and gender and from any walk of life. It can include physical battery, emotional abuse, psychological abuse, financial abuse or exploitation, sexual abuse, and child or elder neglect or abandonment. If you or someone you know is being abused, it's important to seek support and help.</p>
    <center> <h1> What is Elder Abuse?</h1></center>
    <p>- Elder Abuse is recognized as a continually increasing and serious problem in our society. Unfortunately, due to under-reporting, variations in the definition of elder abuse, and the absence of a nationwide uniform reporting system, it is difficult to determine the scope of this issue. The National Center on Elder Abuse distinguishes between seven different types of elder abuse. These include physical abuse, sexual abuse, emotional abuse, financial/material exploitation, neglect, abandonment, and self-neglect</p>
    <center><h1>There are 7 types of Elder Abuse</h1></center>
    <p>Physical Abuse - Use of physical force that may result in bodily injury, physical pain, or impairment</p>
    <p>Sexual Abuse - Non-consensual sexual contact of any kind with an elderly person.</p>
    <p>Emotional Abuse - Infliction of anguish, pain, or distress through verbal or non-verbal acts.</p>
    <p>Financial / Material Exploitation - Illegal or improper use of an elder’s funds, property, or assets.</p>
    <p>Neglect - Refusal, or failure, to fulfill any part of a person’s obligations or duties to an elderly person</p>
    <p>Abandonment - Desertion of an elderly person by an individual who has physical custody of the elder or by a person who has assumed responsibility for providing care to the elder</p>
    <p>Self Neglect- Behaviors of an elderly person that threaten the elder’s health or safety.</p>

            <p>The reasons for individuals who abuse others are difficult to grasp. Why do individuals choose to abuse others is a common question. Another concern is why abused (adult) people continue to remain in abusive relationships. Neither of these problems has an easy answer, and even the most passionate attempt to understand why people make seemingly illogical actions will not provide complete understanding.  Abuse events must be lived through and experienced before the internal logic of abuse occurrences makes sense. We may, nevertheless, make every effort to grasp.</p>
            <p>To the first question, "Why do people abuse other people?" there are various answers. Some of the abusers' negative behaviors were passed down from their parents.Mistreatment and/or watching others being harmed were among their early experiences (one parent abusing the other or their sibling, etc.). As a result, for many people, abuse has become a way of life. These people absorbed a certain interpersonal dynamic, notably the roles of "abuser" and "victim." They are familiar with and understand the terror of being the helpless victim from their own childhood experiences.</p>
            <p> Rather than being a victim, being abusive is the exact opposite of being a victim.  When offered the choice between being an out-of-control victim or an in-control abuser, some of these individuals opt for the abuser role. As children get older, they simply flip the interpersonal dynamic, acting out the "abuser" side of the dynamic they have learned. By choosing to be the aggressor and abuser, they may have their first feeling of having control over their own fate and not being at the mercy of others. The knowledge that they are causing harm to others may go unrecognized or seem as a hazy part of their consciousness. </p>
            <p>Mental health concerns or diseases can also lead to abuse.  Someone with anger management difficulties, an IED diagnosis, or a drinking or drug problem, for example, may easily lose control during fights(e.g., because their capacity to stop oneself at the brain level is weakened) and verbally or physically assault their partners and dependents. </p>
            <p>Abusers like these are unable or unable to relate to others as people, preferring to treat them as things. As a result, they cause others to misinterpret things. Individuals are treated as though they exist just for their personal advantage and do not have a distinct, meaningful life. Abusers who abuse their victims in this fashion are likely to be both psychologically and physically sick. They may suffer from antisocial (sociopathic, psychopathic) or narcissistic personality disorders, as well as violence, impulse control, and drug abuse issues.</p>
            <p>Such individuals may abuse because of the benefits they derive from it, such as sexual or financial gratification, or just the allure of having power over other people's lives.Consider any dictator who comes to mind as a personification of this type of personality (Saddam Hussain seems to fit well and comes to mind easily). Tony Soprano, the protagonist of HBO's "The Sopranos," is an excellent example of this type of character. Tony's character is intriguing to watch since he is aware of his tendency towards narcissistic sociopathy and fights it with varying degrees of success at various times.Others abuse because they lack empathy, either owing to a brain injury or because they were mistreated as childhood and never fully developed their innate empathy capacities.</p>
           <center><b><h2>What are some clear indicators that someone is being abused?</b></h2></center>
<p> The following are some warning indicators, according to the National Domestic Violence Hotline:</p>
<p>- In front of others, their partner taunts them.</p>
<p>- They are continuously concerned that they may irritate their companion.</p>
<p>- They find reasons to justify their partner's actions.</p>
<p>- Their companion is very possessive or envious of them.</p>
<p>- They've got markings or injuries that aren't explained.</p>
<p>- They've given up socializing with their friends and relatives.</p>
<p>- You observe changes in their personality, perhaps they are unhappy or nervous.</p>
<p>If you suspect a friend or family member is being mistreated, listen to them and inquire about their well-being. It's possible that the individual who is being mistreated isn't ready or able to leave the relationship right now.</p>
