                    <p>A great deal of abuse in life is unavoidable, and can only be escaped
                        once it has taken place. However, there are also some forms of abuse
                        that people get exposed to in their lives that can be avoided to some
                        extent if proper precautions are put in place early on.</p>
                   <center><h1>If you are an adult:</h1></center>
                    <p>You can take the time to learn what abuse is and
                        isn't, so that you immediately recognize abuse if it occurs to you or
                        someone close to you.</p>
                        <p>If you have a tendency to be passive in
                            relationships with others, you can learn to be more assertive,
                            particularly in communicating your boundaries and what is acceptable
                            and not acceptable to you.</p>
                        <p>If you have a tendency to be very assertive with
                            others, you may want to consult with others you trust so as to make
                            sure you are not habitually and unconsciously cross over the line from
                            assertiveness into abuse. If you are told you tend to be aggressive
                            rather than assertive, you can learn how to become more assertive
                            rather than aggressive in your interactions.</p>
                    <center><h1>If you are a parent, you should teach your child in age-appropriate ways</h1></center>
                    <p>To identify what abuse is and isnâ€™t and how to avoid circumstances that might lead to abuse.</p>
                    <p>The difference between appropriate and inappropriate touching.</p>
                    <p>What their body parts are and how they are
                        appropriately named so that they can properly describe it if someone
                        touches them in an inappropriate place.</p>
                    <p>That someone might threaten them with violence
                        if they tell about inappropriate behavior, but that they should always
                        tell you.</p>
                    <p>That they are allowed to say "no" when someone
                        asks them for something they don't want (being assertive), especially
                        with strangers.</p>
                        <p>You should also watch your kids for signs that something has changed
                            for the worse (behavioral, physical or personality changes that suggest
                            something disturbing has occurred), and ask them direct questions if
                            you suspect the worst. Take the necessary steps to track abuse down and
                            stop it from repeating immediately. Please strongly consider getting
                            your children and perhaps your entire family involved in professional
                            psychotherapy with a therapist specializing in the treatment of abuse
                            if your children have been abused.</p>
                    <center><h1>If you are dating:</h1></center>
                    <p>Expect that you might be drugged if you are drinking,
                        and take precautions. Never let your drink out of your sight. Use a
                        Rohypnol test kit to test if your drink has been spiked</p>
                    <p>Use the buddy system. Go out with friends and do not let each other out of your sight</p>
                    <p>Be wary and do not take unnecessary and
                        unintelligent risks (such as going home with strangers or meeting them
                        in a non-public place)</p>
                    <p>Tell someone at home where you are going and when you will be back.</p>
                    <p>If you do choose to engage in sexual behavior, be
                        very clear and explicit with your partner about the level of sexual
                        activity you are and are not willing to engage in.</p>
